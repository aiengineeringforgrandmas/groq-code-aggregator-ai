CodeWeaverAI is a powerful Streamlit application designed to assist users in preparing and analyzing codebases for use with AI models. It aggregates an entire GitHub repository into a single, organized Markdown file, making it easy to feed to AI systems for tasks like code summarization, question answering, and code generation. ðŸ§ 

Key Features:
- Aggregates all files from a GitHub repository, including code, documentation, and configuration files.
