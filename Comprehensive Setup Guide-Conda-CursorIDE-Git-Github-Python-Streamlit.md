pip install streamlit numpy pandas matplotlib
```

Alternatively, if you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setting Up Your Streamlit Project

### Creating a New Streamlit App

1. In CURSOR IDE, create a new file called `app.py`.
2. Add the following code to create a basic Streamlit app:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("My First Streamlit App")
st.write("Welcome to my Streamlit application!")

# Add more Streamlit components as needed
```

### Setting Up GitHub Integration

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Give your repository a name
   - Choose whether to make it public or private
   - Don't initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license

2. In CURSOR IDE, open the Source Control view (icon in the left sidebar).
3. Click on "Initialize Repository" to create a local Git repository.
4. Stage your changes by clicking the "+" next to each file or using "Stage All Changes".
5. Commit your changes by entering a commit message and clicking the checkmark icon.
6. Click on the "..." menu in the Source Control view and select "Remote > Add Remote".
7. Enter the URL of your GitHub repository and press Enter.
8. Push your changes to GitHub by clicking on "Publish Branch" in the Source Control view.

### Creating Essential Files

1. Create a `.gitignore` file:
   - In CURSOR IDE, create a new file named `.gitignore`
   - Add the following content:

```
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.so

# Environments
.env
.venv
env/
venv/
ENV/

# Streamlit
.streamlit/secrets.toml

# Miscellaneous
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

2. Create a `.env` file for environment variables:
   - Create a new file named `.env`
   - Add any environment variables you need, e.g.:

```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
```

3. Set up Streamlit configuration:
   - Create a folder named `.streamlit`
   - Inside `.streamlit`, create two files: `config.toml` and `secrets.toml`
   - In `config.toml`, add general Streamlit configurations:

```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#F63366"
backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#F0F2F6"
textColor = "#262730"
font = "sans serif"

[server]
enableCORS = false
```

   - In `secrets.toml`, add any secret configurations (make sure this file is in your `.gitignore`):

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
db_username = "your_username"
db_password = "your_password"
```
## Running and Deploying Your Streamlit App

### Running Your Streamlit App Locally

1. In CURSOR IDE, open a terminal (if not already open).
2. Ensure your Conda environment is activated:

```
conda activate streamlit-env
```

3. Navigate to the directory containing your `app.py` file (if not already there).
4. Run your Streamlit app with the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

5. Your default web browser should open automatically, displaying your Streamlit app. If not, copy the URL shown in the terminal and paste it into your browser.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

While GitHub Pages doesn't directly support running Python applications, you can use it to host a static website that links to your Streamlit app deployed on a platform like Streamlit Community Cloud. Here's how to set it up:

1. Deploy your app on Streamlit Community Cloud:
   - Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud
   - Sign in with your GitHub account
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the `app.py` file and deploy

2. Create a simple HTML page to redirect to your Streamlit app:
   - In your project root, create an `index.html` file with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Streamlit App</title>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=https://your-app-url.streamlit.app" />
</head>
<body>
    <p>If you are not redirected, <a href="https://your-app-url.streamlit.app">click here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Replace `https://your-app-url.streamlit.app` with the actual URL of your deployed Streamlit app.

3. Commit and push the `index.html` file to your GitHub repository:

```
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add redirect page for GitHub Pages"
git push
```

4. Set up GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Settings"
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`)
   - Click "Save"

5. Your GitHub Pages site will now be live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`

## Additional Git Commands for Managing Your Project

Here are some common Git commands you'll use to manage your project:

1. Check the status of your repository:
```
git status
```

2. Add changes to staging:
```
git add .
```

3. Commit staged changes:
```
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

4. Push changes to GitHub:
```
git push origin main
```

5. Pull changes from GitHub:
```
git pull origin main
```

6. Create a new branch:
```
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

7. Switch between branches:
```
git checkout branch-name
```

8. Merge branches:
```
git merge branch-name
```

## Tips for Package Management
